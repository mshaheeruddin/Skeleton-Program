When the image is diplayed, it will not be the inteded image.
So, in the Cat,25,59,A, the image width got shorter and its legth got bigger. 

We have recieved an error: Image data error beacause the image is too big as we give it
the value of 59. And there are too many lines with dots at the bottom of the image.

Only the top part of image is diplayed and and bottom part is excluded showing
only the cat's head without its body. 


Each row pixels would now have column pixels
